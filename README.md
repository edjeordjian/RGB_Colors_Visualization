# RGB Colors Visualization

Really basic PHP script for visualzing colors through the Hex RGB system used in HTML. It may take some minutes to finish (obviously is completely system dependent, but that may apply to the majority of common PCs). 

To arbitrarily reduce resource demand, the 'step' for showing colors can be increased (using a power of 2 as step is encouraged), although it will reduce the effect of the visualization (i.e., it would look less appealing).

For example, using a step of 65536 would make the script end in less than a minute (for most PCs), but the resulting visualization would lack a lot of colors.

# How do I run it? 
For example, with WAMP (on Windows), LAMP (on Linux) or MAMP (on Mac) and any browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, Opera...). There are a lot of other options.
