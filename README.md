# RGB Colors Visualization

Really basic PHP script for visualzing colors through the Hex RGB system used in HTML. It may consume a lot of resources, and it may take some minutes to finish (obviously is completely computer dependent, but that may apply to the majority of common PCs). 

To arbitrarily reduce resource demand, you can increase the 'step' for showing colors (really encouraged: always use a power of 2 as step), although it will reduce the effect of the visualization (i.e., it would look less appealing).

For example, using a step of 65536 would make the script end in less than a minute (for most PCs), but you would lose a lot of colors.

# How do I run it? 
For example, with WAMP (on Windows), LAMP (on Linux) or MAMP (on Mac) and any browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, Opera...). There are a lot of other options.
